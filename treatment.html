                    <h1> Treatment</h1>
                    <p>There is no one treatment for autism spectrum disorder at the moment (ASD). 
                        However, there are several methods for reducing symptoms and increasing skills.
                        If people with ASD receive the right therapies and interventions, 
                        they have the best opportunity of utilizing all of their strengths and capabilities.
                        The most successful therapy and interventions are frequently unique to each individual. 
                        Most persons with ASD, on the other hand, benefit from highly organized and specialized programs.
                        Treatment for autism can assist people in everyday tasks and minimize symptoms 
                        in certain circumstances.
                        Early diagnosis and therapies, such as those provided during preschool or before, 
                        have been shown to have a significant favorable impact on symptoms and subsequent skills. </p>
