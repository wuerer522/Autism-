                    <p>Autism, often known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a group of disorders marked 
						by difficulties in social skills, repetitive activities, speech, and nonverbal communication. 
						Autism affects 1 in 44 children in the United States today, according to the Centers for Disease Control
					</p>
					<p>
						We now know that there are numerous subtypes of autism, the majority of which are influenced 
						by a mix of genetic and environmental variables. Autism is a spectrum illness, which means that
						each person with autism has their own blend of strengths and challenges. Autism affects 
						how people learn, think, and solve problems in a variety of ways, from highly proficient 
						to severely handicapped. Rare persons with ASD may require a lot of help in their daily life, 
						while others may require less help and, in some situations, none at all
